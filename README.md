# Polymorphic C


A study purpose C-implemented polymorphism framework. It mainly demonstrates how polymorphism works using a pure procedural programming language (C) without extra parser or compiler involved.

This is a show-case project rather than a product. If you want to use polymorphism in your project, just choose an OO language.
